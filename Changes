Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Audit::Attach.

0.92  Sat Feb  8 13:00:00 2003
	- Now relies on MIME::Head to recognize attachments.
	  "Never try to be too clever."
	- No more warnings.

0.91  Thu Feb  6 22:30:00 2003
        - Now recognizes attachments with Content-Disposition inline,
          but a given filename. This became necessary because Netscape
   	  Communicator and other clients send their attachments that way.

	  Thanks to Jeff Engelhardt and Vladimir Parkhaev for bringing
          this to my attention.
